All-In-One

This is my first project from scratch that is almost finalized

It containes:
Ruby on Rails framework
A blog with articles
A chatroom with ActionCable

grid & Styling
I have used Semantic-ui sass for grids and styling. I found it easier and more styling possibilities than a basic bootstrap.


User Authentication and Authorization
I had alot of difficulties with "Devise", I found it difficult to customize routes and styles. So, I did it from scratch myself. Ofcourse, this problem with "Devise", is probably because of my lack of knowledge.

Forms & Their Functionality
This was done through the usage of Rails functionality and Semantic designs. Even though there's a lot of styling left to be done, but, basic design and functionalities are solid.
