# README

# All-In-One

This is my first project from scratch that is almost finalized

It containes:

**Ruby on Rails framework

**A blog with articles

**A chatroom with ActionCable

# grid & Styling:

I have used Semantic-ui sass for grids and styling. I found it easier and more styling possibilities than a basic bootstrap. Ofcourse, it is not done. I will be working on it on daily basis.


# User Authentication and Authorization:

I had alot of difficulties with "Devise", I found it difficult to customize routes and styles. So, I did it from scratch myself. Ofcourse, this problem with "Devise", is probably because of my lack of knowledge.

# Forms & Their Functionality:

This was done through the usage of Rails functionality and Semantic designs. Even though there's a lot of styling left to be done, but, basic design and functionalities are solid.
